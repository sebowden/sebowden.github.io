I received my BS in Ecology (2009) and PhD in Ecology (2016) from the [Odum School of Ecology](https://www.ecology.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/) under the direction of [Dr. John M. Drake](https://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab/). I did my postdoc (2016-2017) with [Dr. Barbara A. Han](https://www.caryinstitute.org/science-program/our-scientists/dr-barbara-han) at the [Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies](https://www.caryinstitute.org/). Currently, I am the lead data scientist for the Office of Innovation, Development, Evaluation, and Analytics (IDEA) within the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ) at CDC.
